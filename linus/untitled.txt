**** Taxonomy
Use the 99% classifier (https://forum.qiime2.org/t/fungal-its-analysis-with-qiime2-current-recommended-workflow/30809/6)


**** Beta diversity:

k-mer based ITS diversity analysis:

Instead of doing phylogeny, we should perform kmer based alpha and beta diversity
k-mer length selection is imortant and can influence the results: a first range would be 12-16bp


FunGut Process
For beta analysis we should do both Jaccard and Bray Curtis analysis based on kmers
Then we need to do dimensionality reduction and ordination (see slide 16 of w7 slides)
Then do quality and quanitiy comparison 
    -> Peramnova: either centroids (center of spider web of sample points (shortest total distances)) are statistically significantly distant or not
                   Look at q value not p value (because it is a pairwise comparison(?))
                   Secondary test after adonis permanove is betadisper (?) in qiime2 or bdisper, measures community disperse -> We want to know if it is actually due to the disperson of the samples

When you run different effect size ?? something about you can pull more information out of it when you use different effect sizes


Questions:
- Should we kmerize our ITS features for beta diversity? If so is it just a simple command?
- How can we do quality control? 
- How do we find "optimal" kmer length? What metrics is useful for us? We want higher effect size
